### Hi there, I'm Lukasz ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack Javascript software developer focused on the front-end, driven by curiosity and desire to build usefull and eye-catching products.

I enjoy learning about dechnology and it's applications in the real life. In my carrer so far, I have focused on application of technology to financial topics working at Zalando, EY and PwC. 

I am currently planning a new project with GraphQL, Nest and Next.js as well as further expand on React and TypeScript.
